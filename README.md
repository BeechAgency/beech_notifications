Add popups and notifications to your site using the WYSIWYG editor. It is simple and stripped back and ad free. Updates are relased through the repo here on GitHub.

== Description ==

Create different kinds of notifications on your site. Banners, top bars, toasts, sticky things on the right. You name it. More will be added in time.

Popup plugins typically kinda suck. They are either hella complicated, or just a wall of ads and spam. We were sick of it so built this.

It's simple to keep things simple. 

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Upload `beech_notifications.zip` wordpress.
2. Configure the settings and it should just work
3. Dial in the CSS using the settings to make it better match your theme.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will you provide support? =

No. This is as is and used for our purposes. It should work but we can't help troubleshoot it. Maybe log a bug in the issues thing and we'll try and resolve it.


== Changelog ==

= 0.1 =
* Proof of concept release

= 1.0 =
* Rebuilt the entire plugin based on a Class structure
* Notifications are now created and managed using Notifications under the Tools menu.

== Roadmap ==

There are a lot of ideas for this and it could be made into something really great. Here are a couple that are in the pipes

1. More notifiction types
2. Test mode for notificationsâ€”ability to preview would be helpful
3. More logic rules for displaying notifications
4. Useful settings
5. Configure design through the settings
6. Design notifications more visually, maybe Guttenburg?
