# BEECH Notifications Roadmap

There are a lot of ideas for this and it could be made into something really great. Here are a couple that are in the pipes


## High priority

- Preview mode for individual notifications
- Configure more design elements through the settings (started in 1.4!)
- Settings based on specific notificiation type (i.e. position of the right corner, it could be top or left!)
- Give notifications a cookie setting (how long before it comes back?)

## Medium priority

- More notifiction types
- More logic rules for displaying notifications - i.e. time delay, pages visited etc.
- Make the editor make sense. It's current rather confusing, not going to lie.

## Ideas

- Design notifications more visually, maybe Guttenburg?
- Confirmation pages
- Better form tool integration

## Completed

1. ~~Test mode for notificationsâ€”ability to preview would be helpful~~ Done globally in 1.2
2. ~~Useful settings~~ In 1.2.
3. ~~Configure design through the settings~~ Initial version with 1.2
4. ~~Make notifications work without end date.~~ In 1.4
5. ~~Give notifications a start date~~ Works with wordpress future publishing status
